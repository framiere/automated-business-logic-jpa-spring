<h1>Bus Logic Demo (Spring edition)</h1>
	
<h2>What is this?</h2>
This directory contains a copy of ABL's BusLogicDemo project, pre-configured for Spring.

  <p>BusLogicDemo is a very simple application, which demonstrates the use of some of the basic
  concepts in ABL. See <a href="http://www.automatedbusinesslogic.com/home/bus-logic-demo">ABL's web site</a> 
  for more information on what this app does.
  <p>
  In this Spring-enabled version, we show how easy it is to integrate ABL's transactional logic engine into
  a Spring application.

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

To run this demo, you will need to have Spring 3.0, which must be installed and running properly.
In other words, you should be able to create and run a Spring project.
<p/>
This project also uses Maven to retrieve most of its libraries. If your IDE has a Maven plugin (and most do),
you will probably benefit from installing it.
<p>
You may consider using <a href="http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts">SpringSource Tool Suite</a>, 
which is a special edition of Eclipse with all kinds of facilities for Spring. 
The integration is well done, and it's a powerful environment for Spring work.
However, it is not required for this demo.
<p/>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Installation should be a breeze:
<ol>
	<li>Download the demo (if you're reading this, you probably figured that part out already)
	<li>Import the BusLogicDemoSpring directory into Eclipse or STS as a project (if you use a different IDE, 
	you should still be able to do that, but we have not tested that)
	<li>Run the application on a server. We use Tomcat 7.0, but any reasonably recent server should do.
	<li>Connect to <a href="http://localhost:8080/spring-autobizlogic-demo">http://localhost:8080/spring-autobizlogic-demo</a>
</ol>

<h2>What to do in the app</h2>

Once you are in the app, we suggest that you do the following to exercise the business logic:

<h4>Edit a customer's credit limit</h4>

Change the credit limit for Alpha and Sons to something less than the current balance. This will
violate a constraint, which will roll back the transaction and display a message.

<h4>Mark an order as paid</h4>

If you mark any order as paid, the customer's balance will be decreased by that order's amount.

<h4>Change a line item's product</h4>

Using the drop-down, change a line item's product. Notice how:
<ol>
	<li>the unit price is updated (copied from the new product)
	<li>the amount is recomputed
	<li>the order's total is recomputed
	<li>the customer's balance is recomputed (assuming the order is not paid)
	<li>if the customer's new balance exceeds the credit limit, an error message appears
</ol>
<p/>
While this may all seem simple, there is actually quite a bit going on here. In this particular case, the following rules were involved:
<p/>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="font-size: 10pt;">
	<tr>
		<td width="60%" class="code">
@ParentCopy("product.price")<br/>
public void deriveProductPrice() { }
		</td>
		<td>
 	 The product's price was copied to the order item's productPrice.
 	 	</td>
 	 </tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">
@Formula("productPrice * qtyOrdered")<br/>
public void deriveAmount() { }
		</td>
		<td>
 The order item's amount was then be recomputed, since productPrice had changed.
 	 	</td>
 	 </tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">
@Sum("lineitems.amount")<br/>
public void deriveAmountTotal() { }
		</td>
		<td>
 	 The order's amountTotal was then be recomputed, since one of its items' amount had changed.
 	 	</td>
 	 </tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">
@Sum("purchaseorders.amountTotal where paid = false")<br/>
public void deriveBalance() { }
		</td>
		<td>
 	 If the order is not paid, then the customer's balance was recomputed, since one of the unpaid orders' amountTotal had changed.
 	 	</td>
 	 </tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code" nowrap>
@Constraint(value="balance <= creditLimit",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errorMessage="Customer balance exceeds credit limit")<br/>
public void constraintCreditLimit() { }
		</td>
		<td>
 	 Finally, the customer's freshly-updated balance was compared to the credit limit, and, if it exceeded it, the transaction was rolled back.
 	 	</td>
 	 </tr>
</table>
<p/>
Notice that we never specifically invoked any of these rules. They were invoked automatically as part of the commit process. 
And they were invoked <b>in the correct order</b>, because the logic engine understands the dependencies between them.
<p/>
This means that the application doesn't have to know (or care) about the rules, and can just focus on the task at hand 
(allowing the user to manipulate data), rather than worry about enforcing the underlying business logic.

<h4>Visualizing the rules</h4>
If you select the <code>Show events</code> checkbox at the bottom of the page, any changes you make to the data
will result in the display of all the rules that were executed within the transaction.

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>

We hope this very brief introduction to declarative business logic has been worth your time.
This demo is a <b><i>very</i></b> simple example, but the same concepts can be used to create very
sophisticated transactional applications. Please visit
